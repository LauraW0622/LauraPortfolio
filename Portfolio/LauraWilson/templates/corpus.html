                        I'd like to compare writings from 1930's through the 1960's to radio plays of around the same time. 
                        I expect to find similar phrasing between the two writings. I ran some 3-grams on a collection of radio plays
                        and magazine articles of the same period. The 3-gram didn't reveal much as you can see above.

                        Since the 3-gram was unrevealing, I tried to refine my corpus sets to suspense radio plays and fiction writings from 
                        1938 to 1961. Unfortunately, it seems that the radio plays have alot of HTML in them, so when I ran a 5-gram on the collection
                        there isn't much in the way of phrases, but more a collection of HTML phrases. It looks as though I may need to find a
                        differnt collection or refine the data in the current collection.
